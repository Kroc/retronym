Object file:

* meta-data
* imports and exports
* functions
* raw data
* calculations
* relaxtion joints
* control flow points

Data to link would be a stream of control blocks that would specify what to do with the block before linking

Functions are essentially a named set of control blocks that are applied on-site.

Macros are expanded whilst creating the object file;
objects have no internal notion of macros.
